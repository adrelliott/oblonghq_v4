                    <p>We’ll be straight with you - there aren’t too many organisations that are the right fit for us.</p>
                    <p>Mainly because we insist that every client needs to:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Truly believe that employees have the right to choose where in the world they work</li>
                        <li>Genuinely want to support (not control) every employee, regardless of where their desk is</li>
                        <li>Be ready to implement strategies and systems that will move the organisation towards a fully hybrid team model</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>If you’re nodding your head at these three criteria, then don’t you think <a href="/book">we should talk</a>? </p>

                    <p>We’re not your average people-based consultancy. </p>
                    <p>We don’t regurgitate dry, academic studies about how your organisation should be - after all, you and your team know the organisation best.</p>
                    <p>So, every single project we take on starts with an anonymous survey of your team (and leaders) to find out what is going well, and what could be better.</p>
                    <p>It’s only after we determine all the pain points that we start designing systems &amp; strategies to help you recruit the right people, engage your existing employees, and build a culture where your team cares as much about your business as you do.</p>
                    <p>If this sounds good to you, then <a href="/book">book a call</a> with one of our team to discuss the next steps.</p>
