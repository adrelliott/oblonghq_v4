                                Hybrid teams are a mixture of onsite, Work From Home (WFH) and remote employees - in fact, in this post-pandemic world, employees can fall into all three categories in any one week.

                                Following the enforced lockdown, many employees have discovered that the felixibility of working from home vastly improves their quality of life. It's been proven to increase output too!

                                Although hybrid teams are not new, this model of working is new to many organizations and leaders. Without proper systems and support in place, at best productivity will drop, and at worst, you'll lose key employees to leaders who embrace hybrid teams.

                                Probably not. Even if further lockdowns didn't happen, enforcing a permenant on-site presence is likely to have a hugely detrimental effect on morale. Embracing the hybrid model means attracting and keeping high-quality talent.
